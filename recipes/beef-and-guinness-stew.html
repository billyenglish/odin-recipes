    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor.<br>
        The maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green<br>
        onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year.

        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 onions, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (14.9 ounce) can dark beer (such as Guinness)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>

        <li>4 cups mashed potatoes (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Cook and stir bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until<br>
            bacon is browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and<br>
            transfer bacon into a large stew pot, reserving bacon fat in the skillet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Season beef chuck cubes generously with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper<br>
            to taste. Turn heat to high under the skillet and sear beef pieces in the<br>
            hot fat on both sides until browned, about 5 minutes. Place beef in the stew<br>
            pot with bacon, leaving fat in the skillet. Turn heat down to medium; cook<br>
            and stir onions in the retained fat in the skillet until lightly browned, 5<br>
            to 8 minutes; season with a large pinch of salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cook garlic with onions until soft, about 1 minute. Pour beer into the skillet<br>
            and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up and dissolving any browned bits of food<br>
            into the liquid. Pour cooking liquid from the skillet into the stew pot. Stir in<br>
            tomato paste, carrots, celery, thyme sprigs, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and<br>
            enough chicken broth to cover.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bring stew to a gentle simmer, stirring to combine; reduce heat to low and cover pot.<br>
            Simmer stew until beef is fork-tender, about 2 hours. Stir stew occasionally and skim<br>
            fat or foam if desired.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove cover and raise heat to medium-high. Bring stew to a low boil and cook until stew<br>
            has slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard thyme sprigs and adjust salt<br>
            and pepper to taste.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Arrange mashed potatoes in a ring in a serving bowl; ladle stew into the center of the potatoes.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
